# prime-num-calc-qt
A very fast Qt program for prime numbers calculation with appropriate UI. As an example, the prime numbers from 1 to 100 millions were computed that took less than 3 minutes and the result has been presented in the form of a Matlab workspace file (.mat). Also from 1 to 1 billion, the computation takes about 40 minutes.
